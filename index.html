    <h1>Lowville Tapes .</h1>
    <h2>by Casey Watkins. </h2>
    <p>Hello. 
The tracks on this page are digitized versions of audio from cassettes which I personally recovered. I found them while on a trip to visit my relatives upstate near Lowsville . They were sitting in a case with a camcorder under a tree trunk in an abandoned section of town I was exploring. Since it seemed like they had been abandoned a while ago, I took them home. Although the camcorder was damaged beyond use or repair, the cassettes were in relatively playable condition. While none of the video footage worked, I was able to recover and clean some of the audio… which is what I am sharing with you on this page. 

I still can’t wrap my head around what happens on these tapes. It sounds ominous - and potentially tragic.
